# Guessing Game

This is a simple command-line guessing game written in Rust. The program generates a random number, and you try to guess it. After each guess, you will be told if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to this project folder.
3. Build and run the game with:

   ```sh
   cargo run --release
   ```

   This command builds the game in release mode, which is optimized for better performance.

   If you want to run the game in debug mode (useful for development and testing), use:

   ```sh
   cargo run
   ```

   Debug mode builds faster but is less optimized.

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
